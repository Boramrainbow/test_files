,"Only cells B2 and E2 are summed because, for each column (B through E), the values in both rows 3 and 4 must meet criteria1 and criteria2, respectively. Cells B3 and B4 meet both criteria, as do E3 and E4. However, neither C3 nor C4 meet either criteria. Finally, although D4 meets criteria2, D3 fails to meet criteria1.",,,
