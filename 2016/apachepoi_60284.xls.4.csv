Notes:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Metal Film Leaded resistors are usually OK up to 100 MHz,,,,,,
1206 SM Resistors are good up to about 1GHz.,,,,,,
0805 SM Resistors give good results up to 1.5GHz,,,,,,
Above this , 0402 can be used but have low power rating.,,,,,
,,,,,,
1206 and 0805 can still be used up to a few GHz but allowance needs to ,,,,,,
be made for parasitic inductances and capacitances.,,,,,,
This limits the frequency range.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
High value pads can be difficult at high frequencies.,,,,,,
Often it is better to use 2 x 10dB (one PI & one T) rather than one 20dB pad.,,,,,,
