Example 6:  Value of a resistor in an electrical circuit.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Find the value of a resistor in an electrical circuit that will dissipate the charge to 1,,,,,,,,,,,,
percent of its original value within one-twentieth of a second after the switch is closed.,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This model depicts an electrical circuit containing a battery, switch, capacitor, resistor, and ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"inductor.  With the switch in the left position, the battery charges the capacitor.  When the switch",,,,,,,,,,,,
"is thrown to the right, the capacitor discharges through the inductor and the resistor, both of",,,,,,,,,,,,
which dissipate electrical energy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Using Kirchhoff's second law, you can formulate and solve a differential equation to determine",,,,,,,,,,,,
how the charge on the capacitor varies over time.  The formula relates the charge q[t] at time t,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to the inductance L, resistance R, and capacitance C of the circuit elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use Solver to pick an appropriate value for the resistor R (given values for the inductor L and,,,,,,,,,,,,
the capacitor C) that will dissipate the charge to one percent of its initial value within ,,,,,,,,,,,,
one-twentieth of a second after the time the switch is thrown.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem and solution are appropriate for a narrow range of values; the function represented,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the charge on the capacitor over time is actually a damped sine wave.,,,,,,,,,,,,
