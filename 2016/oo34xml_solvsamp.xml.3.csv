Example 3:  Personnel scheduling for an Amusement Park.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For employees working five consecutive days with two days off, find the schedule that meets demand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from attendance levels while minimizing payroll costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal for this model is to schedule employees so that you have sufficient staff at the lowest cost.  In,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this example, all employees are paid at the same rate, so by minimizing the number of employees working",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"each day, you also minimize costs.  Each employee works five consecutive days, followed by two days",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Problem Specifications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Target cell,,D20,,Goal is to minimize payroll cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Changing cells,,D7:D13,,Employees on each schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constraints,,D7:D13>=0,,Number of employees must be greater than or equal,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,to 0.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,D7:D13=Integer,,Number of employees must be an integer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,F15:L15>=F17:L17,,Employees working each day must be greater than or,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,equal to the demand.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possible schedules,,Rows 7-13,,1 means employee on that schedule works that day.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this example, you use an integer constraint so that your solutions do not result in fractional numbers of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
employees on each schedule.  Selecting the Assume linear model check box in the Solver Options ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialog box before you click Solve will greatly speed up the solution process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
