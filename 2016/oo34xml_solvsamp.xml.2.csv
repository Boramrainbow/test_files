The problem presented in this model involves the shipment of goods from three plants to five regional,,,,,,,,,,,,
"warehouses.  Goods can be shipped from any plant to any warehouse, but it obviously costs more to",,,,,,,,,,,,
ship goods over long distances than over short distances.  The problem is to determine the amounts,,,,,,,,,,,,
to ship from each plant to each warehouse at minimum shipping cost in order to meet the regional,,,,,,,,,,,,
"demand, while not exceeding the plant supplies.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Problem Specifications,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Target cell,,B20,,Goal is to minimize total shipping cost.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Changing cells,,C8:G10,,Amount to ship from each plant to each ,,,,,,,,
,,,,warehouse.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constraints,,B8:B10<=B16:B18,,Total shipped must be less than or equal to ,,,,,,,,
,,,,supply at plant.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,C12:G12>=C14:G14,,Totals shipped to warehouses must be greater,,,,,,,,
,,,,than or equal to demand at warehouses.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,C8:G10>=0,,Number to ship must be greater than or equal ,,,,,,,,
,,,,to 0.,,,,,,,,

You can solve this problem faster by selecting the Assume linear model check box in the Solver ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Options dialog box before clicking Solve.  A problem of this type has an optimum solution at which,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amounts to ship are integers, if all of the supply and demand constraints are integers.",,,,,,,,,,,,
