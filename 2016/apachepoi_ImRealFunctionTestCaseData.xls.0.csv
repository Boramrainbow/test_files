This spreadsheet contains various test cases for the functions: ImReal
Name of the main junit test class which uses this spreadsheet:
org.apache.poi.ss.formula.functions.TestImRealFunctionsFromSpreadsheet
(The content of cell 'Read Me'!A3 is confirmed by the test)

Every sheet besides this first one contains formula evaluation test cases in a standardised format.
"On row 4 of each sheet, in columns B,C,D there are the column headings ""Formula"", ""Expected Result"" and ""Comment"""
"The test iterates down from row 5 onward  until a the text ""<end>"" is found in column A.   Rows with ""<skip>"" in column A are ignored (useful for currently unsupported behaviour).  Otherwise column A can be used for commenting the group of rows below. "
"If the evaluated result of column B does not match the expected result in column C, the junit test will report a failure.  Test failures get annotated with the section and row comments, if any."
"Besides the first 4 columns, row 5 onwards, the junit test does not inspect any other cells in the sheet.  The other cells can be used freely to set up test data."
"Care should be taken to not only make the values in column C match those in column B, but also to make sure column C contains only simple literal values.  This can be achieved easily by 'pasting special' from column B to C, selecting the 'as values' option."
