Example 1:  Product mix problem with diminishing profit margin.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your company manufactures TVs, stereos and speakers, using a common parts inventory",,,,,,,,Color Coding,,,
"of power supplies, speaker cones, etc.  Parts are in limited supply and you must determine",,,,,,,,,,,
the most profitable mix of products to build. But your profit per unit built decreases with,,,,,,,,,,   Target cell,
volume because extra price incentives are needed to load the distribution channel.,,,,,,,,,,,

"This model provides data for several products using common parts, each with a different profit margin",,,,,,,,,,,
"per unit.  Parts are limited, so your problem is to determine the number of each product to build from the",,,,,,,,,,,
inventory on hand in order to maximize profits.,,,,,,,,,,,

Changing cells,,D9:F9,,Units of each product to build.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Constraints,,C11:C15<=B11:B15,,Number of parts used must be less than or ,,,,,,,
,,,,equal to the number of parts in inventory.,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,
The formulas for profit per product in cells D17:F17 include the factor ^H15 to show that profit per unit,,,,,,,,,,,
"diminishes with volume.  H15 contains 0.9, which makes the problem nonlinear.  If you change H15 to",,,,,,,,,,,
"1.0 to indicate that profit per unit remains constant with volume, and then click Solve again, the",,,,,,,,,,,
optimal solution will change.  This change also makes the problem linear.,,,,,,,,,,,
