"If you're a financial officer or a manager, one of your tasks is to manage cash and short-term investments in a",,,,,,,,,,,,
"way that maximizes interest income, while keeping funds available to meet expenditures.  You must trade off",,,,,,,,,,,,
the higher interest rates available from longer-term investments against the flexibility provided by keeping funds,,,,,,,,,,,,
in short-term investments.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This model calculates ending cash based on initial cash (from the previous month), inflows from maturing",,,,,,,,,,,,
"certificates of deposit (CDs), outflows for new CDs, and cash needed for company operations for each month.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have a total of nine decisions to make:  the amounts to invest in one-month CDs in months 1 through 6;,,,,,,,,,,,,
the amounts to invest in three-month CDs in months 1 and 4; and the amount to invest in six-month CDs in,,,,,,,,,,,,
month 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The optimal solution determined by Solver earns a total interest income of $16,531 by investing as much as",,,,,,,,,,,,

constraints.,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Suppose, however, that you want to guarantee that you have enough cash in month 5 for an equipment",,,,,,,,,,,,
payment.  Add a constraint that the average maturity of the investments held in month 1 should not be more,,,,,,,,,,,,
than four months.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The formula in cell B20 computes a total of the amounts invested in month 1 (B14, B15, and B16), weighted",,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the maturities (1, 3, and 6 months), and then it subtracts from this amount the total investment, weighted by",,,,,,,,,,,,

"shifted funds now mature in month 4 and, according to the present plan, are reinvested in new three-month ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"CDs.  If you need the funds, however, you can keep the cash instead of reinvesting.  The $56,896 turning",,,,,,,,,,,,
over in month 4 is more than sufficient for the equipment payment in month 5.  You've traded about $460 in,,,,,,,,,,,,
interest income to gain this flexibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,
