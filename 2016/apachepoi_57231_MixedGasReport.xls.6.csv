COMPRESSED GAS LOSS GUESS-TIMATOR
"Procedure for using the UE SYSTEMS INC. ULTRAPROBE 3000, 9000 or 10000 to locate and roughly measure gas leakage in compressed gas systems."
Use the Scanning Module to conduct the broad scanning and to pinpoint the gas leaks. The Scanning Module with the rubber focusing probe should be held 15 inches away from the point of the leakage.
Use the Scanning Module to conduct the broad scanning and to pinpoint the gas leaks. The Scanning Module with the rubber focusing probe should be held 35 centimeters away from the point of the leakage.
